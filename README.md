### Abstract

<p style="text-align:justify;">CameraSHOT is a simple and effective application software designed to alter the theme or color scheme of an image effortlessly. Inspired by Windows’ adaptive theme feature, which automatically selects an accent color from the desktop background for various interface elements, CameraSHOT takes this concept further. It analyzes the pre-existing theme or color scheme of an image and modifies it with minimal user intervention. The core principle of CameraSHOT is to examine an image and alter its theme or color scheme comprehensively.</p>

### Project Description

<p style="text-align:justify;">The internet offers billions of free wallpapers, yet there are times when users may wish to change the theme or color scheme of an image. Theme alteration goes beyond merely changing the image background; it involves adjusting the color scheme at the pixel level while preserving the original components, details, and quality. Although theme alteration can be achieved using advanced image editing software like Adobe Photoshop, this process is often time-consuming and requires significant manual effort. Most image editing software does not provide specific tools tailored for color scheme alterations, making it a cumbersome task for users.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A practical example of theme alteration can be observed through two images taken outdoors from the same point and angle at different times of the day, such as morning and evening. The morning image might feature a bluish sky with a yellowish hue and high brightness, while the evening image might display a reddish sky with an orangish hue and a comparatively dull appearance. With CameraSHOT, users can transform the morning image to resemble the evening one and vice versa with just a few clicks.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">CameraSHOT is designed with simplicity in mind, offering a button-based, click-to-go mechanism that enables users to perform impressive alterations to an image with minimal effort. The software comes pre-packed with features such as scheme priority alteration, scheme swap, and scheme casting, allowing for a wide range of theme modifications. CameraSHOT’s intuitive interface requires no prior knowledge of complex tools, making it accessible to all users. The software is minimalistic and self-explanatory, requiring zero dependencies, making it the perfect tool for altering the theme of jpeg/jpg images.</p>

#### Scheme Swap

<p style="text-align:justify;">With the scheme swap feature, users can interchange the existing color scheme of an image with a new one, effectively transforming the overall appearance of the image. This feature is particularly useful for creating variations of the same image with different color themes.</p>

#### Scheme Casting

<p style="text-align:justify;">Scheme casting enables users to apply a predefined set of color schemes to an image, providing a quick and efficient way to achieve professional-grade theme alterations. Users can choose from a variety of preset themes to enhance their images.</p>

### Technical Implementation

#### Pixel-Level Analysis

<p style="text-align:justify;">CameraSHOT performs a detailed pixel-level analysis of the image to accurately identify and alter the color scheme. This method ensures that the theme alteration is comprehensive, affecting every pixel while preserving the image’s original components and details.</p>

#### Automated Process
