### Abstract

<p style="text-align:justify;">CameraSHOT is simple and effective application software that aims to work
upon or alter the theme/color-scheme of an image. The application is inspired by Window's adaptive theme feature that automatically picks an accent color from the desktop background for Start, taskbar, action center, and title bar. CameraSHOT, however, analyses the imageâ€™s pre-existing theme/color-scheme and alters it with almost zero assistance from the user. The basic principle behind the software rests in analysing an image and altering its theme or color scheme.</p>


### Project Description

<p style="text-align:justify;">There are billions of free wallpapers available on the internet. Yet, one
may sometimes feel the need of altering the theme/color-scheme of an image. Theme alteration is not just changing the image background, rather theme alteration refers to changing the color scheme of an image from
its root, from every pixel, to maintain the original components, details, and quality. Theme alteration is a subset of image editing, thus, theme alteration is possible with a good image editing software like, Adobe Photoshop, but usually, it is time-consuming, as the image editing software generally do not provide much assistance or the required environment particularly to work upon image’s color scheme. Rather, the user has to do most of the work manually, which is again time-consuming and not convenient for the users. One good implementation of theme alteration can be explained using a simple real-life experience. For two images, taken in outdoor, from the same point and the same angle, at two different points in time in a particular day, say, around morning and evening will only differ by its theme. The image taken around the morning will have a bluish sky with a yellowish shade and will be highly bright. The image taken in the evening, however, will have a reddish sky with orangish shade, will be comparatively dull. With a theme editing software like CameraSHOT, the former image can be converted into the latter one, and vice-versa, with just a few clicks.
CameraSHOT has proved to be a simple, button-based, click-to-go mechanism based software, which allows its users to do an incredible alteration to an image with few mouse-clicks. CameraSHOT comes pre-packed with the features like scheme priority alteration, scheme swap, scheme casting, etc. Every kind of theme alteration is possible with these tools. CameraSHOT does not expect its user to have any prior knowledge of tools and the user interface of the software is very minimalistic and self-explanatory. CameraSHOT requires zero dependencies and is the perfect tool for alternating the theme of
a jpeg/jpg image.</p>
